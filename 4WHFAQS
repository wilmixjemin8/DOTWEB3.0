   => It  Prevent Code Stealing.
    =>Focused  on  Protoype  software.
    =>Mainly  used  to  create  datastructures   as  fast  as  possible.


3) How   DOTWEB3.0  formed?
 ===========================

At   Year  2013  wilmix  jemin    worked  in Developing  a   userfriendly  framework  in  java.  
But  he  notice  a   demerits in  java  that   java  source  code  can  be  taken  using  JAD decompiler.
 That is   Jad  decompiler  can easily convert  .class   file  to  java  file easily.  
So  it   is  more   difficult   to  invent  a  technology and framework   in  java/j2ee. 
 By  using  Spring  and  Hibernate  it  takes  long  time  to  complete  it   for  a  huge  project. 
 So  if  a  small  company  take  more   employees  and  fails  in  project  by  using  java/j2ee. 
Then  it  will  bring   more  loss  for  the  company.
Another  one   demerits  in  java  is    Developers  had  to  spend  more  time   in  
writing  code .  
DOTWEB3.0  provides  a  optimized   and  obsucated  code  than  any  technology.
If  you look  on  Dotnet  demerits  ; Dotnet  source  code  can  be  taken using  code reflector. 
 So  both  the   technologies  failed    at   90% . 
 So  I  suggest  to  invent  a   helper  and  friendly  technology  for  both  technology  java  and  dotnet 
ie)  known  as  DOTWEB3.0. java/j2ee  on  the  other  hand  completly  fails   ;
In the  same  way  php  Technology  also  fails  since    so  it  is   difficult  for  a  client  to  handle  big  projects.. 
 if  you  run  a  php  wamp server   and  right  click the  mouse  on  the  browser  you can  easily  take  what  php  code  is  written. 
So  client  cannot  focus  webdesign  by  using  php  technology. 
so  i  suggest  to  invent  a  technology  known  as  JSTAR  technology  which  is  focused    for   webdesign.


4) What  are  the  Major  Advantage of  DOTWEB3.0 ?

The major advantage in DOTWEB3.0 is high security, interaction, webapplication  ,  and  RemoteWebapplication.
DOTWEB3.0 has many frameworks and latest technologies than java.DOTWEB3.0 itself a Big sky technology.
DOTWEB3.0 maintains shortest code which maintain High qualities.
Another major advantage of DOTWEB3.0 is Advanced business.
DOTWEB3.0   is   150 times  Greater   than  JAVA.
So  it  is    called   as  Advanced   Programming  Language.
DOTWEB3.0   has   many  servers  focused  on   many  projects.



5)   How    is  DOTWEB3.0  Professional  software is  different   from  enterprise  software?

DOTWEB3.0  Professional  software  is  a  free  version and  opensource and  it   has  limited  time  validity of  one  month.
for    every  month   software    will    be  updated   on   Tutorial website  not  on this   website.
This  Website   is  focused  only   for    Tutorial /Demos  /Samples    on  DOTWEB3.0ProgrammingLanguage.
Only  Core DOTWEB3.0  and JWP  Trail version  is permitted
for  professional use.

DOTWEB3.0  Enterprise  software    is  used   only   by  companies   and  IT  CLIENTS.
DOTWEB3.0  Enterprise   Software   contains   100  Advantages +  Enterprise/Professional  Online course + VSLASH SERVER + DOTWEB3.0-cdollar-Linux platform software  and  DOTWEB3.0-SAUCER.

DOTWEB3.0  Enterprise   Software   is   available  with   Professionals /Enterprise  course.
Course   duration   is  upto  1 month  only.  +  DOTWEB3.0   Programming
Language   certification ] .  DOTWEB3.0  Enterprise  Software   is  not  opensource.


6)  Which   one  did   JWP(DOTWEB3.0WebPages) follow?
 What  is  the  main purpose  of using  JWP   according  to  the  research?

JWP(DOTWEB3.0WebPages)  is   used   with Dotnet, Java frameworks(Struts,Spring,hibernate) and  EJB,etc for webapplication.JWP  provides   optimized   code  and  it  is  User friendly  ,interactive  Programming  Language. Easy and   very fast to use webapplication, Provide Code  obfuscation  automatically when it  is  compiled  by  server.
JWP  saves  time   and  cost  for  the  clients.
