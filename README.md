# DOTWEB3.0
============




DOTWEB3.0 or DOTWEB3.0  Programming Language  is  for  Webapplication/RemoteWebapplication-Type-2   

and  it  is   invented  by  wilmix jemin j in   CHDollar(CH$)  P.L   @  2013


DOTWEB3.0 PART1

==================



Definition: "DOTWEB3.0 is an interactive , System

programming, OOPS, Multipurpose, Advanced Technology

focused on  Webapplication/RemoteWebapplication-Type-2 , web and GUI development".


Meaning :
==========

DOTWEB3.0 stands for Success ,security, and prosperity and it is ranked as it is ranked

as WORLD Rank Z'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

(infinitive power infinitive) and so,on.

and DOTWEB3.0 is (infinitive power infinitive) times greater than JAVA/j2ee.


What   is  the  difference   between Remotewebapplicationserver  and  webserver?
 ==========================================================================

  Remote  webserver application    is   an  application    operates    with
  client-server.but  it  will  post  and  get  objects   from  server that  can  be
  exchanged through out  sessions  or  with  in   two   computers  ;  where   as   one  act   as  client
  and  other  act   as   server.
  eg)  When  you enter   details  using  CH$  program  that   creates   a   data  object
  called  as .dsn  file;  that can  be  exchanged  through  out   sessions.
  Difference  between   webserver  and  remoteserver  means   remotserver  
has   remote-client  connection  but  webserver don't have.
Data flow  is  unknown   using  DOTWEB3.0  architecture.  where   as  in   
webserver  and  application server  like  tomcat,JSTAR SERVER,Jboss server,  etc;  here  dataflow  is  known.
JSTAR  webserver   is used   only   for  webdesign  so   we  don't  focus   remote webapplication with  high security.
JSTAR  is  focused  on normal    remote  webdesign.
In webserver  data  will   be   sent  between  client(browser)  and  server
is  known  to users.so  this   indicates   webserver   has  no  security  but  remoteserver  using   DOTWEB3.0  architecture
has  more   security  according  to  research.
Remoteserver   uses http +  socket  connection    where   as webserver uses   only  http  connection
Remote web  application server  =>  webserver  +  Applicationserver +  datasecurity.
So  DOTWEB3.0 is  most  advanced in  security   side. but  it  has  more  framework  and  latest technology
and  follows  shortest  code    than  any  technology and  including  advanced  business and  many  advantages
over  other  technologies. When  you  host   DOTWEB3.0  or  Chdollar  Servers   in  any  of  your   today
available   hosting   provider.  You   can   see  DOTWEB3.0  or   Chdollar   website   at  your  mobile phone
or  at  internet.



When it was Invented? Who invented it?

JWEB project took place from year 2017  and  invented  in  DOTWEB3.0  by wilmix jemin j .

 And DOTWEB3.0 is the main reason for creating remoteserver.

but DOTWEB3.0-cdollar is invented in java p.l.

What will happen when you create remoteserver in java?

It will take 2 years to complete.

DOTWEB3.0 can create a remoteserver in 4 hours.

It uses DOTWEB3.0-java runtime to run the programs.

Using DOTWEB3.0 we can easily construct Remoteserver for security side than java.



ABOUT DOTWEB3.0 Programming Language

Merits of  DOTWEB3.0
===================


 =>It is Good to create any compilers..and Advanced Operating systems,easy  to  focus, learnable, interaction,AdvancedBusiness, and utilities.
 => => => It has simpilified code
   => =>it  is     learnable  ,easy  to use, and   let  developers to  focus  only    C#/OAKJAVA7/C++/CH$  Programming  Language
 => it  can  be  used   to  execute   .exe  files.
 

Note: 
=====

Only  DOTNET, CH$ ,  GDollar,JAVA8, OAKJAVA7, JWEB-JAVA ,C/C++ Professionals ,SLING,NDOTWEB3.0,JSWORD,JAVAFrameworks Professionals

will  follow this  DOTWEB3.0  Programming Language.
