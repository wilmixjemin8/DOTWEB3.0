DOTWEB3.0FAQS
================


A) Difference  Between  native  Programming  Languages and  other programming languages? Why it is learnable?


A) Difference   between  JAVA,DOTWEB3.0 and  other  programming languages..?


Core JAVA  SYNTAX:
============


public class  <Filename>

{



public  static  void  main(String args[])

{


<!  JAVA LOGIC!>

}


}

Major  demerits:
===============

A)  It  is  only  50%  learnable.
Even  when  the  interviewer  ask  Difficult  questions  on  java/j2ee.
Professional  fail  to  answer  it. so  it  is  only  50% learnable;
so  it  is  more  difficult  for  the  interviewer  to  select  the  candidates
according  to our  research and  this   is  real  and  fact  today...
if  the  interviewer  ask  questions  on  java spring
to  write   a  code  it  is  impossible;  since  java spring  has
bulky code  and   difficult  syntax. so java is  not  learnable.

B)  JAVA Source  code   can  be taken  using  JAD  decompiler....
So it  is  very difficult   to  computerize all office  files.

C)  Doesn't  saves  time  and  cost.

D) MORE  BULKY CODING.





DOTWEB3.0  SYNTAX
==================

//Beginning  of  JDollar  Program
<JDollar>

//  can use  any   Jdollarutil packages...
<USE> packages;

//<PACK>  is  the  namespace

<PACK> packagename

{

// <CLASS>  means  class  and  <CLASS>  is  the  attractive  syntax.

public  <CLASS>  <classname>

{

 // C /C++ like syntax.. and  here  the  first  letter  of  main()  f(x)  should be  capitalize...

public void Main()

{

<!  DOTWEB3.0 Logic !>  // C/C++  like  oops  logic

// so it  is   very   easy to  learn  for  professionals.

}

}

}



Note:  we  can  use  to construct  .dll  and  use  it  in other  DOTWEB3.0 programs...


ADVANTAGES
=========

A)   It  is  a  100%  learnable programming language.  so  interviewer  can  ask  any  difficult  or  medium  or  easy

questions  on  dotweb3.0 programming language..

b)  Provide  high  code security

c) we  can  use  to construct  .dll  and  use  it  in other  DOTWEB3.0 programs...

d) We  can  create  a  prototype  software   with  code  security  as  easy  as  possible..

e) Saves  time  and  cost.

f) Very  less  coding   and  has  atractive  syntax...

g)  Interactive  technology

h)  C/C++  like  oops  ; so even a   school   boy  can  easily  learn it...

i)  It  is Opensource

j) It  is used  with  OAKJAVA7(JAVA7.0)

k) More  Advanced.

l)  Lot  of  frameworks  in DOTWEB3.0.

n)  Solve  many  complex  problems  which  java and other  programming 
languages  cannot  solve  it..

and  so -on



B) Why  it  is  more  important  than other  Programming Language?  Why  we  focus  DOTWEB3.0 Programming Language ?

1)  DOTWEB3.0 Programming language  has  Advanced Business but  other  programming languages  cannot. Advanced Business  is  meant  for  prosperity.

2) DOTWEB3.0 Programming language  has  optimized  code  but  other  programming languages  cannot.This  saves  time  and  cost  for  development.


3) DOTWEB3.0 Programming language  is  interactive  with  Dotnet(.net) , java frameworks, php,C/c+, chdollar,gdollar  p.l .so  it  is   easy  to  develop  a  webapplication /remotewebapplication ...

4)  DOTWEB3.0 Programming Language  provides  more  code  security,obfuscate code  than other  programming language.

5)   DOTWEB3.0 Programming Language  can  also  be  used  in  creating  Operating  system, compilers  with  in  few  days..

6)  DOTWEB3.0 Programming Language  has  large  amount  of  frameworks  where  other  programming language  cannot.

7)  DOTWEB3.0 Programming Language  has  more  advantages  than  other  programming languages.

8)  DOTWEB3.0 Programming Language  is  a  standalone Programming Language .

9) DOTWEB3.0 Programming Language  has  J$AGENT  to  store  the  data in a  securable  manner.

10) DOTWEB3.0 Programming Language has Advanced business to balance the computer field and to make projects available at any time..
 This results in cooperation ,unity, save time and cost ; and it will build friendship among co-workers.. DOTWEB3.0 Programming Language will bring Prosperity ,unity,J$AGENT memmory management and high security.

11) DOTWEB3.0 Programming Language  is  most  advanced  than other
programming  language.
